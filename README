Welcome to the Qantas Guide!

Qantas Guide is a service (designed to be part of Qantas' existing app) designed to provide better in-airport experience to customers. It was developed after input from various different mentors and employees from Qantas during Qantas Code-Sare Hackthon 2016.

It is a prototype previewing what could actually be accomplished with very little economic investment and a bit more organisational changes to existing procedures and operations at Qantas.

This wiki contains the source as well as screenshots of the app we developed for the same.
